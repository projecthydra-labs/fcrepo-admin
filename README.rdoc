== Hydra Administrative Tool for a Fedora Repository

A Rails engine providing an administrative interface to a Fedora Commons repository built on the Hydra project framework.

=== Status

This project is at an early stage of development.  It should be considered experimental and not ready for production deployment.

=== Requirements

fcrepo_admin is designed for installation on hydra-head 6.0.0 or higher.  
See https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/wiki/Installation-Prerequisites.

=== Installation

* Add to gemfile

    gem 'fcrepo_admin'

  Then <code>bundle install</code>

* Run the blacklight and hydra generators

    rails g blacklight --devise
    rails g hydra:head -f
    rake db:migrate
    rails g hydra:jetty  # if you need a development copy of jetty with solr and fedora

* Mount the engine

  In config/routes.rb add this line:

    mount FcrepoAdmin::Engine => '/admin', :as=> 'fcrepo_admin'

  You may replace <code>'/admin'</code> with any mount point, including <code>'/'</code>.  
  All routes include <code>objects</code> as a subpath.

* Extend the SolrDocument model
  
  In app/models/solr_document.rb add this line:

    use_extension FcrepoAdmin::SolrDocumentExtension

  (This may only be necessary if customizing the catalog show as indicated below.)

* Add Javascript
  
  In app/assets/javascripts/application.js add this line: 

    //= require bootstrap-tab

* Customize catalog show page (optional)

  If you would like to add Fedora object information to the catalog show page, 
  copy the partial <code>app/views/catalog/_show_default.html.erb</code> from the Blacklight 
  gem to your application, then add to the bottom of the file:

    <%= render :partial => 'fcrepo_admin/show', :locals => {:document => document} %>

  Use Blacklight's config options in CatalogController to control the basic content on the show page 
  (HTML title, page title, and list of the fields/values at the top of the page).
